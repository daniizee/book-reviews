# book-reviews
The objective of this project was to review a dataset on book sales and figure out which was the most profible book.
After cleaning the dataset, it was determined that several metrics could be used to identify what a "most profitable" book could be. 
It could be the most book sold or it could be the book with the highest price. However, since we are unaware of the margin on each book sold, we could not base 
the analysis on the book with the highest price.
